# Upcoming

## [29 - 30 March] Matplotlib/GraphXD sprint

Visualizing the structure of graphs is a crucial component of network analysis,
and it has limited support in the Python community. NetworkX is the community
standard in representing and analyzing graphs, but it is not meant to be a
visualization package. NetworkX has some simple visualization capability, but
it is not a fully-featured solution for visualizing graphs, and is a maintenance
burden on their core development team. On the other hand, Matplotlib is the core plotting library
in the Python ecosystem, though it has no official support for graph structures.

At [GraphXD](https://graphxd.github.io/workshop/2018.html>)
we have brought together core members of the NetworkX and
Matplotlib communities. During the week's sprints, we'll work together to
improve the state of graph visualization in Python. We have the following goals:

* Build a small library in Python that utilizes Matplotlib and NetworkX for
  visualizing graph structures.
* Factor out the visualization components of NetworkX into this library, such that
  the analytics features of NetworkX are separate from the visualization features of
  the new library.

We plan for this package to continue growing beyond the GraphXD sprint, and to
become a community standard in visualizing graphs with Python. 

**Dates**: March, 28th and 29th
**Location**: Berkeley Institute for Data Science


## [28 May–2 June] Joint scikit-learn, scikit-image, dask sprint

scikit-learn and scikit-image are two of the major scientific Python toolbox,
enabling data-driven discoveries. The first one proposes simple yet efficient
tools for data mining and data analysis, while the latter focuses on image
processing algorithms. With the flow of data being processed and analysed,
these two libraries face unprecedent scalability challenges.

One currently under-utilized avenue for solving such scalability challenge is
to leverage the Python library Dask, which provides flexible parallelized
NumPy and Pandas DataFrame, the core numerical objects used in Scientific
Python. Our goal is thus to organiza sprint bringing together a small number
of developers from scikit-learn, scikit-image, and Dask to experiment and
improve the three libraries.

**Dates**: May, 28th to June 2nd
