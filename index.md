## [29 - 30 March] Matplotlib/GraphXD sprint

Plotting graphs in Python is right now limited. Matplotlib, the core plotting
library in Python, does not support plotting graphs. As a result, networkx, a
toolbox for working on complex networks, included in its core utilities to
ease visualization of graphs, putting unecessary maintenance stress on
networkx core developers.

Leveraging the presence of Matplotlib (the core plotting library in Python)
and networkx (complex network toolbox) core-developers during [GraphXD](https://graphxd.github.io/workshop/2018.html>), we will be working on
building a small library extending Matplotlib's functionnalities for plotting
networks. A first step will be to extract the visualization support present in
networkx.
 

**Dates**: March, 28th and 29th
**Location**: Berkeley Institute for Data Science


## [28 May–2 June] Joint scikit-learn, scikit-image, dask sprint

scikit-learn and scikit-image are two of the major scientific Python toolbox,
enabling data-driven discoveries. The first one proposes simple yet efficient
tools for data mining and data analysis, while the latter focuses on image
processing algorithms. With the flow of data being processed and analysed,
these two libraries face unprecedent scalability challenges.

One currently under-utilized avenue for solving such scalability challenge is
to leverage the Python library Dask, which provides flexible parallelized
NumPy and Pandas DataFrame, the core numerical objects used in Scientific
Python. Our goal is thus to organiza sprint bringing together a small number
of developers from scikit-learn, scikit-image, and Dask to experiment and
improve the three libraries.

**Dates**: May, 28th to June 2nd
